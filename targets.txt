This plugin is intended to be used in QGIS.
QGIS has the ability to create and store variables that are specific to the software in general, a loaded project or
a specific datalayer in a project. These variables can be called upon on in all sorts of algorithm and expressions.

TARGET:
The intended purpose of this plugin is to read a UI file when it is first used.
The plugin should read the amount of inputfields in the UI file.
It should add the same amount of projectvariables to the QGIS project and name them in a similar way they are named 
in the UI. 

Example: in a UI file there is a comboBox called: comboBox_delta. 
The plugin should create a project variable called comboBox_delta. The value set as [prefix]-[value] should write to the value of the variable.

Everytime the QGIS-project is opened the plugin should read the variables-values and display them when the plugin is loaded.
So the QGIS user doesn't need to set all the values on project startup, instead the plugin uses the last know values.

The intend of this project is to make a plugin that is easily changeable to the end-users needs.

The plugin should be downloadable on GITHUB and distibuted in the QGIS plugin library.
